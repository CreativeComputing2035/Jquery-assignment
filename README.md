# Jquery-assignment
I'm not going to be doing anything major with this read me, as I'm just going to put in the plain text as is, and hopefully it comes out visually-alright. For this assignment, I had a very hard time wrapping my head around Jquery & Javascript. I've been going back and trying to reverse engineer how a certain thing is made and to my luck nothing would happen, so I was very grateful when I saw that you had your uploaded Jquery version as it would allow me to see and manipulate the files directly. Even though I tried to make it so that when you click on the image it is manipulated in different ways, I ultimately was not successful in creating some kind of an effect (& net art) because I used this assignment more to figure out what I was doing wrong and be able to apply that to future assignments. 

I saw that you can substitute the contents of what the "buttons" affect with images, once I even had a different text size and style to see if that would effect it and it did the same thing as it would have to the original boxes, and i ultimately settled on using plainley images. 

I did not focus on making it as visually appealling, but rather to catch up and formally understand what Jquery is and how to use it.
